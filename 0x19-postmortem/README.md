Postmortem

Issue Summary:
Duration: May 10, 2023, 09:00 AM - May 11, 2023, 06:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent downtime and significant performance degradation, affecting approximately 30% of users. Users reported slow page loading times, frequent timeouts, and occasional service unavailability.

Timeline:

May 10, 2023, 09:15 AM (UTC): The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in error rates and response times.
An engineer noticed a sudden increase in support tickets and customer complaints about slow performance.
Actions were taken to investigate the issue, focusing on the application server, network infrastructure, and database systems. The assumption was that a database overload might be causing the performance degradation.
Misleading investigation paths included extensive optimizations of the application server and scaling up the database infrastructure.
The incident was escalated to the development, operations, and database teams for further investigation and resolution.
May 11, 2023, 06:00 PM (UTC): The incident was resolved, and the application was fully restored to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was identified as an underlying network misconfiguration. The network routing tables were outdated, causing increased latency and intermittent connectivity issues between different components of the web stack.

Resolution: The network misconfiguration was fixed by updating the routing tables to ensure optimal traffic flow between the application server, database servers, and other infrastructure components. Additionally, network hardware was upgraded to accommodate higher traffic loads and improve overall network performance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve network monitoring: Implement robust network monitoring tools to promptly detect and alert on any network configuration issues or anomalies.
Regular network audits: Conduct periodic reviews of the network infrastructure to identify and address any misconfigurations or outdated routing tables.
Automation of network updates: Develop automated processes to update network configurations, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of human error.
Redundancy and failover mechanisms: Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms at critical network points to minimize the impact of future network issues.
Disaster recovery testing: Regularly test the web stack's disaster recovery procedures to validate their effectiveness in restoring services in the event of an outage.
Incident response training: Provide incident response training to relevant teams, ensuring they are equipped to quickly identify and address issues to minimize downtime.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch network infrastructure: Apply necessary updates and patches to network hardware and software components.
Conduct network audit: Review the network configuration and routing tables to identify and rectify any misconfigurations.
Automate network updates: Develop scripts or automation tools to streamline the process of updating network configurations.
Implement network redundancy: Introduce redundant network paths and failover mechanisms to improve resilience.
Perform disaster recovery testing: Test the disaster recovery procedures to validate their effectiveness and make necessary improvements.
Provide incident response training: Organize training sessions to enhance the incident response capabilities of the teams involved.
By implementing these measures and addressing the outlined tasks, we aim to enhance the overall stability, performance, and resilience of our web stack, minimizing the likelihood and impact of similar issues in the future.
